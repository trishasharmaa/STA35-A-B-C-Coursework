## Instructions
Upload a PDF file, named with your UC Davis email ID and homework number (e.g., sfrei_hw1.pdf), to Gradescope (accessible through Canvas). You will give the commands to answer each question in its own code block, which will also produce output that will be automatically embedded in the output file.  All code used to answer the question must be supplied, as well as written statements where appropriate. 

All code used to produce your results must be shown in your PDF file (e.g., do not use `echo = FALSE` or `include = FALSE` as options anywhere). Rmd files do not need to be submitted, but may be requested by the TA and must be available when the assignment is submitted.

Students may choose to collaborate with each other on the homework, but must clearly indicate with whom they collaborated.

### Problem 1

Consider the scores of students on exams:

```{r}
scores <- tribble(
  ~id, ~midterm1, ~midterm2, ~final_exam,
  1, 80, 90, 85,
  2, NA, 100, 90,
  3, 75, 95, 60,
  4, 95, NA, 60,
  5, 95, 98, NA
)
scores
```

Return a tibble that is `scores` but with a new column, `final_grade`, that is calculated by the following:

* midterm contribution is 40%, and consists of the largest of the two midterm scores, with missing data treated as zeros
* final exam counting for 60%, with missing data treated as zero

Hint: you may find the function `replace_na()` in `dplyr` useful.
```{r}
score_na<-replace_na(scores,list(midterm1=0,midterm2=0,final_exam=0))

final_grades<- score_na%>%
  mutate(midterm40=pmax(midterm1,midterm2)*0.4,
         final60= final_exam*0.6,
         final_grade=midterm40+final60)
print(final_grades)
```


\newpage 

### Problem 2 

Consider the following dataset:

```{r}
reviews <- tribble(
  ~id, ~reviewtext,
  1, "I had a great experience, the product was as described.",
  2, "Good, but not great. There were some issues.  Awfully crowded.",
  3, "The service was excellent and the staff was very helpful.",
  4, "I had an awful time.",
  5, "Excellent, excellent!"
)
reviews
```
(a) Provide code which modifies `reviews` to have two new columns, `excellent` and `awful`.
  * `excellent` is TRUE if the phrase "excellent" appears in `reviewtext` (with any lowercase/uppercase combos) and `FALSE` otherwise
  * `excellent` is TRUE if the phrase "excellent" appears in `reviewtext` (with any lowercase/uppercase combos) and `FALSE` otherwise

```{r}

library(stringr)
tolower(reviews$reviewtext)
reviews_new <- reviews %>%
  mutate(
    excellent = str_detect(reviewtext,"excellent"),
                                awful= str_detect(reviewtext,"awful"))
  
  

reviews_new

```


(b) Provide code which calculates the percent of reviews where `awful` appears and the percent of reviews where `excellent` appears (any lowercase/uppercase combos), using `summarize`.
```{r}
percent<- reviews_new%>%
  summarise(awful_p=mean(awful)*100,
                         excellent_p = mean(excellent)*100)
percent
  
```

\newpage 

### Problem 3

Consider the following dataset with three variables,

* `customer`, an integer identifying the customer.
* `feedback`, a character string which has the input from a textbox plus `[Rating:#]` where `#` is expected to be a number between 1 and 5
* `day`: day on which feedback is given.

```{r}
feedback_data <- tribble(
  ~customer, ~feedback,                                           ~day,
  1,           "Loved the service! [Rating:5]",                     1,
  2,           "Unsatisfied with the product quality. [Rating:2]",  1,
  3,           "Average experience. [Rating:3]",                    1,
  4,           "Great product, but took too long. [Rating:4]", 2,
  5,           "Not what I expected. [Rating:1]",                   2,
  6,           "Not what I expected. [Rating:x]",                   2
)
```
Provide code which returns a tibble, named `feedback_parsed`, with four columns, `customer`, `day`,  `feedback_text`, `rating`.

* `customer` and `day` are as in the original tibble
* `feedback_text` has all of the text of `feedback` which appears before `[Rating:#]`
* `rating` is an integer if the `#` inside `[Rating:#]` is an integer, otherwise returns NA.



```{r, warning=FALSE}
feedback_parsed <-feedback_data%>%
  mutate(
    feedback_text=sub("\\[Rating:.*", "", feedback),
                   rating=parse_number(str_extract(feedback_data$feedback, "\\[Rating:(\\d+)\\]"))
                   )
feedback_parsed
```





(b) The computation from part (a) should result in a tibble which looks like the following:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
## A tibble: 6 × 5
#  customer feedback_text                        feedback   day rating
#     <dbl> <chr>                                <chr>    <dbl>  <dbl>
#1        1 "Loved the service! "                Loved t…     1      5
#2        2 "Unsatisfied with the product quali… Unsatis…     1      2
#3        3 "Average experience. "               Average…     1      3
#4        4 "Great product, but took too long. " Great p…     2      4
#5        5 "Not what I expected. "              Not wha…     2      1
#6        6 "Not what I expected. "              Not wha…     2     NA
```
Provide code which computes the average rating per day in `feedback_parsed`, ignoring all rows with missing data.

```{r}
avg<-feedback_parsed%>%
  group_by(day)%>%
  summarize(avg=mean(rating,na.rm=TRUE))
avg
```

\newpage 

### Problem 4

Consider the following dataset: 

```{r}
health_data <- tribble(
  ~PatientID, ~Weight_2019, ~Weight_2020, ~Height_2019, ~Height_2020,
  1, 70, 72, 170, 171,
  2, 65, 68, 165, 166,
  3, 80, 82, 180, 181
)
health_data
```

(a) Transform this tibble into a tibble `long_health_data` so that there are four columns:

* PatientID, numeric type
* Weight, numeric type
* Height, numeric type
* Year, numeric type

*Hint*: Inspect the arguments of `pivot_longer()` using `?pivot_longer()`.  Read the documentation for the `names_to`, `names_sep` arguments.

```{r}
long_health_data <- health_data %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -PatientID,
    names_to = c("Metric", "Year"),
    names_sep = "_",
    values_to = "Value"
  ) 
long_health_data
```

(b) Provide code which transforms `long_health_data` into the tibble `wide_health_data` which is back in the wide format, with columns "Weight_2019", "Weight_2020", "Height_2019", "Height_2020".  Check that your calculation was correct by checking `all.equal(wide_health_data, health_data)`

```{r}
# put your code here
wide_health_data <- long_health_data %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = c("Metric", "Year"),
    values_from = "Value"
  )
print(wide_health_data)
all.equal(wide_health_data, health_data)
```
